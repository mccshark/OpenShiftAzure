## Internactive Learning [Portal](https://learn.openshift.com)
Our Interactive Learning Scenarios provide you with a pre-configured OpenShift instance, accessible from your browser without any downloads or configuration. Use it to experiment, learn OpenShift and see how we can help solve real-world problems.

**Foundations of OpenShift**
* Getting Started with OpenShift for Developers
* Logging in to an OpenShift Cluster
* Deploying Applications From Images
* Deploying Applications From Source
* Using the CLI to Manage Resource Objects
* Connecting to a Database Using Port Forwarding
* Transferring Files in and out of Containers

**Building Applications On OpenShift**
* OpenShift for Fuse Developers
* WildFly Swarm development
* Java EE Batch Processing with OpenShift, WildFly
* Eclipse Vert.x development
* Node.js development
* Spring Boot development
* JBoss BRMS Loan Application demo
* Java EE Batch Processing with OpenShift, WildFly

**OpenShift Playgrounds (3.6 and 3.7)**
Playgrounds give you a pre-configured environment to start playing and exploring using an unstructured learning approach. They are great for experimenting with OpenShift, including trying to deploy your own application code.

## OpenShift for Ops Test Drive
HOL [registration](https://www.redhat.com/en/engage/openshift-storage-testdrive-20170718)
### Learn how to run OpenShift Container Platform
The Red Hat® OpenShift Container Platform test drive provides system administrators with a no-cost hands-on lab experience. In a fully functional environment hosted in the cloud, you'll learn how easy it is to install and configure OpenShift. You will explore the features of the platform and learn about standard operational and administrative processes. You only need an SSH client and a web browser to complete the test drive exercises. The test environment will remain at your disposal for 8 hours.

**In this self-paced, hands-on lab environment, you’ll learn:**
* How to install and configure OpenShift Container Platform, including log and metrics aggregation and external authentication.
* How to install and configure container-native storage featuring Red Hat Gluster Storage inside OpenShift Container Platform.
* How to perform basic administrative and maintenance operations.
* Basic application life cycle with health and readiness monitoring.
